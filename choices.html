      <p>Adaptive learning systems are revolutionising education by personalising the content to suit each need. Utilising techniques from artificial intelligence and machine learning, students are provided a tailored education, enhancing their engagement and achievement levels. Selecting the correct adaptive learning system is crucial to gaining full benefits, and external implications must be considered when choosing the best-suited system for an educational institute. By evaluating adaptive learning systems, including the opportunities and risks, we aim to provide insights into the future potential uses of this technology and how individuals and society should adapt to its implementation in education.</p>
      <p>Acknowledging the opportunities and risks adaptive learning systems in education provide, we can identify the possibility of a growing digital divide. It would be naive to believe that this technology will have no impact on the current education system, so ensuring that each student has equal access to the positive benefits of adaptive learning systems is crucial to ensure educational equity and prevent further disparities in access to technology. During Covid-19, the Ministry of Education identified between “60,000 and 80,000 unconnected households where school children were living” (Ministry of Education, 2021). Alongside installing copper or fibre connections, satellite dishes, and mobile base stations to provide internet connection, the Ministry also focused on distributing 16,000 school-owned devices and over 25,000 laptops, Chromebooks and iPads to students attending low-decile schools (Ministry of Education, 2021).</p>
      <p>These efforts of ensuring digital inclusion during a transition to online learning has set precedence of how they can address a digital divide to combat the likely risk of this during the rise of introducing adaptive learning systems into education. To go forward with introducing adaptive learning systems in education, it is imperative that the Ministry of Education and New Zealand government adapt a similar approach in ensuring that all socio-economic schools and individuals have access to a reliable internet connection and device to participate and experience a well-rounded education. Furthermore, we urge and encourage businesses to sponsor and create schemes to help their local communities, this wish is inspired by the new “Quadrent Green lease,” (Keall, 2023).  The leasing firm Quadrent has partnered with BNZ to refurbish laptops and aims to donate 20,000 through this scheme. This initiative also addresses New Zealand’s e-waste recycling problem, addressing environmental implications that have arisen since the Covid-19 pandemic (Keall, 2023).</p>
      <p>Furthermore, with the rise of the use of artificial intelligence outside the classroom, it is only natural to introduce its positive attributes into everyday teaching. Implementing this technology is inevitable, and New Zealand should lead the way in reforming and refining the technology to ensure it is appropriately used at each learning level. To do this ‘The New Zealand Curriculum and Te Marautanga o Aotearoa’ should be adapted to implement guidelines and directions for both state and state-integrated schools. Creating a required introductory course for both students and educators, a basic understanding of what adaptive learning systems are, how they work, and how they can benefit and ease the transition of incorporating adaptive learning systems into education. Understanding the purpose of adaptive learning systems and its use of AI allows students to understand the ethical and privacy concerns of its use.</p>
      <p>It is necessary to remember to include the importance of balance and ensuring that human interaction and in-person teaching remain priorities in everyday schooling and that adaptive learning systems should just be used as a tool to assist and not rely on this technology. This is because, as in any instance of “some people being disempowered and disadvantaged by the implementation of AI technologies in education is accompanied by others being empowered and advantaged” (Selwyn, 2022). Selwyn further states the risk of dehumanisation, loss of human dignity, and selfhood. These risks imply that adaptive learning systems, despite providing a personalised education, still have areas in the current schooling system that remain irreplaceable, and implementing a completed artificially integrated curriculum could prove to be too far. Therefore, adaptive learning systems should solely act as a tool to improve the current education system and not replace it.</p>
