      <h1 class="text-center">Opportunities and Positives of Online and Adaptive Learning</h1>
      <p>Despite many risks and negative things about online learning there are still many opportunities and positive things students can achieve through online learning. An insight was done in Cambodia where it shows the opportunity and how students can take advantage of online learning. Some of the positive things students have come out and say is that they are able to study at their own pace without feeling the pressure of face to face teaching, by learning the material at their own pace students are able to learn time management skills and self discipline. Another opportunity is that there has been an increase in online courses provided by professional institutes. For example, we have Harvard providing free online courses such as learning coding from scratch and being able to use that course in your CV. This shows that as the world is moving towards technology and computers, more educational sectors are transiting into a more online environment for their students to be able to learn freely from home and at their own pace.<a href="https://eds-p-ebscohost-com.ezproxy.aut.ac.nz/eds/detail/detail?vid=0&sid=77146120-227f-4f56-989c-6ad222941c22%40redis&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmU%3d#AN=EJ1395203&db=eric">(Heng, 2023)</a></p>
	  <p>While knowledge and information transfer is a major focus of traditional training, the unique needs of each student are sometimes overlooked. Personalised instruction meets each student's needs and maintains student engagement through adaptation. In order to motivate learners to keep growing and learning, adaptive learning algorithms recommend suitable degrees of difficulty, due dates, and assessments. It may even inspire learners to actively engage in training rather than viewing it as a necessary formality to be fulfilled, thanks to the more individualised and engaging learning experience. By putting them at the centre of their own learning process, learners feel appreciated and inspired. Participation is increased as a result, and information retention is improved. Furthermore, adaptive learning has the potential to lower course dropout rates. When students are pushed to enrol in classes that don't fit their needs, they frequently get demotivated. Learners can customise their learning experience via adaptive learning, which might motivate them to participate more actively in the training process<a href="https://domoscio.com/en/blog/top-5-reasons-to-use-adaptive-learning-3/#:~:text=Learners%20can%20often%20feel%20demotivated,engaged%20in%20the%20training%20process">(Domoscio Smart Data for Learning,2023)</a>.</p>
