      <p>Adaptive learning systems are at the forefront of educational innovation as they can transform the educational success of a student. Technology, in recent years, has provided students with opportunities to expand their educational environment, where they can receive a quality education from anywhere. Adaptive learning systems utilise artificial intelligence (AI), which can capture unseen data to "interpret information, assimilate knowledge, and apply the learned skills to solve specific tasks." (Slomp, Ropelato, Bonatti, & Silva, 2024). This then provides a personalised education for each student to meet their requirements to fulfil their education. This personalised education enhances engagement and achievement and has the potential to revolutionise learning.</p>
	  <p>One current problem with traditional methods of education in today's schooling system is their limitation to teaching different/multiple learning styles. A study from 2012 in the UK showed that 93% school teachers agreed that "individuals learn better when they receive information in their preferred Learning Style," (Newton & Miah, 2017). Many schools are forced to default to a traditional "one-size-fits-all" approach because of limited resources (Mead, 2018). The use of AI has the potential to revolutionise this aspect of education, as a fundamental principle of adaptive learning systems includes "differentiation" (Slomp, Ropelato, Bonatti, & Silva, 2024). Differentiation considers each student's individual skills, interests, prior learning and learning style. Providing a personalised education that caters to the individual allows for greater engagement as students no longer feel restricted by how they are taught in a class. Allowing students to have their own personalised educational material allows students to self-direct and master their studies at their own pace (McGuire, 2021). These skills are unable to be taught in class in a traditional learning environment; however, they are fundamental in everyday life. Creating a strong understanding of self-control, discipline, and other intrapersonal skills will equip students with desirable traits for employment and allow them to grow throughout their careers.</p>

    <p style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center; font-size: small;">Figure 2: Adaptive Process in adaptive learning system (Chen and Zhang, 2008)</p>
      <p>In India, a test was done to see what opportunities were created when 150 medical students adjusted to an online environment, a risk many people identify when introducing adaptive learning systems based online. The test lasted four months, and students later answered survey questions on how they felt about online learning. The results showed that 82% of the students felt more comfortable learning from home and that 74% of the students felt less stressed (Pillai et al., 2023). This was because students were able to record the lecture at home and further review that lecture if needed anytime they wanted.</p>
      <p>Allowing students to complete at least a part of their education online with adaptive learning systems promotes "autonomy," (Slomp, Ropelato, Bonatti, & Silva, 2024). Autonomy, the right to self-govern, provides students the decision of what they want their education to be. This promotes an important skill set, including "self-discipline and time management" (Slomp, Ropelato, Bonatti, & Silva, 2024). Providing students the opportunity to control their education and develop these skills is invaluable and is one of the aspects traditional schools are unable to successfully teach students. Students can work through the work at their own speed, allowing them to set their own goals for completion. This flexibility allows students to master the content and move ahead, preventing students from boredom and disengagement. It also allows students greater time to review unknown material, overall creating a stress-free environment associated with a traditional learning environment (Youngju Lee, 2011). Furthermore, this flexibility provides the opportunity to allow students to balance their external commitments with learning. The flexibility adaptive learning systems provide by being accessible online has the potential to diversify the student population. In high education, 58% of undergraduate students work (Maureen Snow Andrade, 2019). The majority of students would largely benefit from adaptive learning systems as they provide them an opportunity to financially provide for themselves or their families without the uncertainties and unnecessary stress of missing out on important content.</p>
      <p>While knowledge and information transfer is a major focus of traditional training, the unique needs of each student are sometimes overlooked. Personalised instruction meets each student's needs and maintains student engagement through adaptation. In order to motivate learners to keep growing and learning, adaptive learning algorithms recommend suitable degrees of difficulty, due dates, and assessments. It may inspire learners to actively engage in training rather than viewing it as a necessary formality to be fulfilled, thanks to the more individualised and engaging learning experience. Learners feel appreciated and inspired by putting them at the centre of their learning process. Participation is increased as a result, and information retention is improved. Furthermore, adaptive learning has the potential to lower course dropout rates. When students are pushed to enrol in classes that don't fit their needs, they frequently get demotivated. Learners can customise their learning experience via adaptive learning, which might motivate them to participate more actively in the training process (Machado, 2023).</p>
