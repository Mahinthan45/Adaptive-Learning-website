      <p>Adaptive Learning Systems in education, while offering promising opportunities for educational advancement, it also introduces high-level risks which must be considered carefully. These systems, which provide a personalised schooling experience based on each individual student's data, raises risks of potential bias, impact on current traditional teaching methods, and data privacy concerns. Examining the risks associated with adaptive learning systems will highlight the challenges that students, educators, and policy makers will face to ensure that this technology is used ethically, responsibly, and effectively.</p>
		<p>Several sources can introduce bias in adaptive learning systems; this includes data bias, algorithmic bias, and interaction bias (Karumbaiah, 2022). When developing and testing an adaptive learning system which utilises artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques, the diversity and quality of data play a crucial role in the outcomes. Data bias occurs when the training dataset used has overweighted or overrepresented data from a singular group. This has the potential to train the system to develop biassed assumptions and provide unequal learning opportunities to students from the underrepresented groups. Karumbaiah provides an example of a learning system biassed against female students, where it would systematically deliver content below the female students academic level (Karumbaiah, 2022). This has the possibility of reinstating stereotypes and reinforcing inequalities; furthermore, it will provide a lower quality education with poor feedback and ultimately limit future opportunities.</p>
		<p>Furthermore, the algorithmic bias also creates a divide which further disadvantages those who are marginalised. This is because the algorithm designed may use factors such as participation, completion, and attendance as metrics to determine the student's success. These factors could easily be influenced by uncontrolled external factors such as their socio-economic status. Introducing technologies into a school environment which may not cater to all students due to bias is essentially useless and adaptive learning systems are known to adapt to any students needs as "differentiation," (Slomp, Ropelato, Bonatti, & Silva, 2024) remains a desired trait for this technology.</p>
		<p>Interaction bias is introduced based on the way students interact with the system. This includes how many times the student asks for help. Many different reasons could influence this action, including the technological skills of a student, which may be influenced by the resources provided by their environment. Furthermore, social norms and cultural influences could impact how many times a student seeks assistance from the system.</p>
		<p>Adaptive learning systems would further introduce online/remote learning to a students education. Research was conducted in Thailand on how online learning affected students. They used a google forum asking students questions such as, perceptions of the online learning experience and to assess factors that cause challenges in online learning in Thailand. Aroonsrimarakot et al. (2023) concluded that during the time the students did online learning there were many challenges that made it harder to study at home some of the examples were, poor internet connection, temptation by other activities, difficulty understanding the context at home, low motivation and more. The article shows that practical online learning still needs time to develop in order for it to introduce adaptive learning systems into a school curriculum. It also displays that distance learning, with no face-to-face contact with teachers may not suit everyone's needs. We can also compare this article with the research done in Indonesia where they face the same problem when it comes to online learning meaning that it is not just a single country that is having this problem rather the whole world.</p>
		<p>This technology, without regulation, could pose a risk to the teaching profession. Currently, a traditional education is a face-to-face education, however, this advancement allows students the opportunity to learn from home, in their own time. Traditional tasks done by a teacher can be automated, such as the marking, personalised tutoring, and feedback. This could eventually result in the loss of jobs and reduced value of the teaching profession. Furthermore, it could lead to the decrease in physical schools and therefore any social interactions a student would normally receive. Adaptive learning systems' downfall is its reliability on data, as “there are not enough data points in the world to adequately capture the complexities and nuances of who a student is, or how a school functions,” (Selwyn, 2022). This revelation highlights the importance of regulation, and the possible downfall of the education system if policymakers react too slowly and insufficiently to protect current teachers, students, and their school environment.</p>
		<p>Adaptive learning systems approach is to collect data from a student to personalise their educational experience, its appeal is that it creates a definite automated decision without human intervention. It is believed that the data-driven algorithmic system will produce a decision which is “inherently objective and fair,” (Karumbaiah, 2022). This comes at the expense of extensive data collection. Large amounts of data collected in a system have the risk of misuse of data and data breaches. Educational institutes are often a target of cyberattacks as they often have poor cybersecurity and contain personal information about students. Without robust cybersecurity, introducing adaptive learning systems could prove to be dangerous and put students and staff at risk.</p>
