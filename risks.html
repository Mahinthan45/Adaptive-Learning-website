      <h1 class="text-center">Risk and Negative of Online and Adaptive Learning</h1>
      <p>Research was conducted at the University of Indonesia. The method used was asking nine students from different courses about how they feel about online learning and how it affected them. The research used Google Forum as a method to collect data from students. The results showed that students prefer being onsite rather than doing online classes as they can focus better and have better motivation. “ Due to the lack of collaborative and cooperative learning, students feel bored with learning activities that seem monotonous. Due to the boredom they experience, their learning outcomes decrease due to a lack of motivation to learn” <a href="http://jcc.ppj.unp.ac.id/index.php/jripe/article/view/5/5 ">(Purnamaningsih, 2021)</a>. This shows that online learning is still lacking and that being onsite and being taught in person, students will be able to focus better and achieve more.</p>
		<p>Being Online certainly has another disadvantage where students are not able to get immediate feedback from their teachers. When students are having problems with their work or not understanding the context of their course they are able to ask during lecture or during dedicated office hours of their tutors in which their query can be resolved quickly. But with online learning there has not been an effective way for students to receive proper feedback and sometimes students will have to wait weeks for teacher/ tutors' replies <a href="https://e-student.org/disadvantages-of-e-learning/#:~:text=E%2DLearning%20can%20cause%20social%20Isolation,-The%20E%2DLearning&text=Social%20isolation%20and%20lack%20of,%2C%20anxiety%2C%20and%20negative%20thoughts.">( Tamm, 2023)</a>.</p>
		<p>Online adaptive learning certainly has its pros and cons, here are some of the cons of online adaptive learning. Building an app or a course online is time consuming and also has a higher cost, as this is time consuming to build it will be easier and quicker for students to learn face to face from their teacher rather than to wait for an app that is not 100% ready and is unsure whether or not it is up to standard for teaching. Another thing is that engagement level in “One challenge in online adaptive learning is keeping students on task, requiring engaging technology” <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/343258626_A_Brief_Analysis_of_the_Pros_and_Cons_of_Online_Adaptive_Learning_and_Education ">(Phillips et al., 2020)</a>. This means students are having trouble with being able to concentrate in class and that if online adaptive learning is to continue there need to be a technology or app that can help students engage more and stay motivated.</p>
		<p>Online learning might not be accessible to everyone. Looking at the New Zealand statistics, 4.99 million of New Zealanders have access to internet making it 95.9% but this also means that 4.1% of the population does not have access to internet and these percentage of the people in New Zealand will be at a disadvantage has they will not have access to online learning material compared to the other 95.9% of the population <a href="https://datareportal.com/reports/digital-2023-new-zealand#:~:text=There%20were%204.99%20million%20internet%20users%20in%20New%20Zealand%20in,percent">(Kemp, 2023)</a>.</p>
		<p>Research was conducted in Thailand on how online learning affected students. They used a google forum asking students questions such as, perceptions of the online learning experience and to assess factors that cause challenges in online learning in Thailand. Research concluded that during the time the students did online learning there were many challenges that made it harder to study at home some of the examples were, poor internet connection, tempted by other activities, difficulty understanding the context at home, low motivation and more. The article shows that online learning still needs time to develop in order for it to match with face to face teaching and that it shows that online learning may not be suitable for everyone. We can also compare this article with the research done in Indonesia where they face the same problem when it comes to online learning meaning that it is not just a single country that is having this problem rather the whole world.<a href="https://link-springer-com.ezproxy.aut.ac.nz/article/10.1007/s10639-022-11530-6 ">(Aroonsrimarakot, 2022)</a></p>
