      <h1 class="text-center">What's Adaptive Learning All About?</h1>
      <p>
        In the fields of education and learning, there's a growing buzz around
        adaptive learning technology. Conceptualized by B. F. Skinner in the
        1950s, this idea started with a teaching machine that adapted questions
        based on previous answers, allowing students to learn at their own pace.
        Fast forward to today, and we've got AI supercharging this concept
        (Weir, 2019).

          >(Weir, 2019)</a

      </p>
      <p>
        Since the 1950s, tech has evolved like crazy. One big leap is in
        artificial intelligence (AI). The “AI boom” in the 1970s and 1980s
        showed us just how powerful machines can be at processing data and
        learning from it. Thanks to this, we now have advanced adaptive learning
        systems that use AI and machine learning to create a dynamic and
        responsive learning environment (Nawaf Alajlani, 2023).
      </p>
      <p>
        Adaptive learning systems tweak the content, pace, and instructions in
        real-time based on a student's needs. By analyzing personal data, these
        systems offer personalized education, boosting engagement and promoting
        self-driven problem-solving skills (Alam, 2023). As AI continues to
        evolve, these systems will keep getting better, ensuring top-notch
        personalized learning experiences.
      </p>
      <h1 class="text-center">Topic Justification</h1>
      <h2>The Pandemic Effect</h2>
      <p>
        In 2020, the global pandemic flipped the education world upside down,
        pushing everyone into online learning overnight (Junio & Bandala, 2023).
        This sudden shift turbocharged the adoption of digital tech in schools.
        With everyone scrambling to adapt, the spotlight turned to adaptive
        learning systems powered by AI and machine learning. These systems
        offered a way to keep education personal and effective, even from a
        distance (Nawaf Alajlani, 2023). Exploring these systems is not just
        fascinating but essential to understanding their vast potential and
        inherent risks.
      </p>
      <h2>Long-Term Implications</h2>
      <p>
        The importance of adaptive learning systems extends far beyond the
        immediate needs of online learning in today’s learning culture. These
        systems remain important as they have the potential to address long-term
        educational challenges, which traditional teaching can not support. By
        leveraging adaptive learning systems and data the systems can
        “continuously adjust” (Slomp, Ropelato, Bonatti, & Silva, 2024) and
        create a personalised learning experience and optimise efficiency of how
        they gain their information. With the use of AI, all types of learning
        can be tailored to, as “differentiation” is fundamental principle of
        adaptive learning systems (Slomp, Ropelato, Bonatti, & Silva, 2024).
      </p>
      <h2>A Tool for Teachers</h2>
      <p>
        Additionally, the implications of adaptive learning systems are
        important to teachers. As a data driven method of education, adaptive
        learning systems provide an accurate representation of a student’s
        progress and performance in relation to specific topics, questions, and
        other areas of their learning. With this data, teachers can maximise
        their effort and ensure that all students meet the requirements in the
        most appropriate and effective way possible.
      </p>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Exploring adaptive learning systems is both timely and crucial in
        today’s educational climate. The advancements of AI and machine learning
        have presented opportunities to the fields of education and learning
        which can revolutionise the traditional methods, ensuring that all
        students are provided with the best education possible. However, the
        risks with this advancing technology must also be recognised and
        investigated to be managed currently.
