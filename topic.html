      <p>In the fields of education and learning, there has been a growing interest in adaptive learning technology. Adaptive learning is believed to be conceptualised by American behaviourism B. F. Skinner in the 1950s <a href="https://trainingindustry.com/magazine/mar-apr-2019/adaptive-learning-3-0/#:~:text=The%20first%20instance%20of%20what,focused%20on%20incremental%20skill%20building">(Weir, 2019)</a>.Skinner invented a teaching machine which adapted questions presented to the student based on previous answers and used incremental skill building to allow the student to study at their skill level and move at their own pace. This machine laid the foundation for the development of adaptive learning systems with modern technology.</p>
	  <p>Since the 1950s, there have been huge developments in technology and how it can be used to create a greater educational experience, one substantial advancement is in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). The “AI boom” in the 1970s-1980s, has displayed the significance and the capabilities of machines to process relevant data and learn from it. Because of these advancements, there has been an increase in research, investment, and development of adaptive learning systems. AI and machine learning techniques are now used to enhance the educational path of the learner in real-time to create a dynamic and responsive learning environment (Nawaf Alajlani, 2023).</p>
	  <p>Adaptive learning systems utilise a student’s real-time data to adjust the content, pace, and instructions to ensure the individual educational needs of the student are met. By analysing relevant personal data, the system can create personalised education which students may feel is best suited to them, and therefore increases engagement and promotes “a self-driven and self-directed problem- solving skilled approach,” (Alam, 2023) to learning. As AI continues to evolve, these systems will also be able to continuously improve and adapt, ensuring that students will always access the best personalised learning experiences.</p>
	  <h1 class="text-center">Topic Justification</h1>
	  <p>In 2020, the global pandemic caused a swift shift to online learning and “has drastically changed the landscape of education around the world.” (Junio & Bandala, 2023). Since this, there has been an accelerated need and adoption of digital technologies for educational use. As schools and other educational institutes transitioned to an online learning environment, the demand for adaptive learning systems which utilised AI and machine learning techniques also increased significantly. With adaptive learning systems drawing techniques from an ever-growing field, such as AI and machine learning, (Nawaf Alajlani, 2023) there are potentially endless opportunities and risks which are interesting to investigate.</p>
	  <p>The importance of adaptive learning systems extends far beyond the immediate needs of online learning in today’s learning culture. These systems remain important as they have the potential to address long-term educational challenges, which traditional teaching can not support. By leveraging adaptive learning systems and data the systems can “continuously adjust” (Slomp, Ropelato, Bonatti, & Silva, 2024) and create a personalised learning experience and optimise efficiency of how they gain their information. With the use of AI, all types of learning can be tailored to, as “differentiation” is fundamental principle of adaptive learning systems (Slomp, Ropelato, Bonatti, & Silva, 2024).</p>
	  <p>Additionally, the implications of adaptive learning systems are important to teachers. As a data driven method of education, adaptive learning systems provide an accurate representation of a student’s progress and performance in relation to specific topics, questions, and other areas of their learning. With this data, teachers can maximise their effort and ensure that all students meet the requirements in the most appropriate and effective way possible.</p>
	  <p>Exploring adaptive learning systems is both timely and crucial in today’s educational climate. The advancements of AI and machine learning have presented opportunities to the fields of education and learning which can revolutionise the traditional methods, ensuring that all students are provided with the best education possible. However, the risks with this advancing technology must also be recognised and investigated to be managed currently.</p>
